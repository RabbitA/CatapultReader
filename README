Octave/Matlab Catapult inertial motion unit .raw file reader. Reverse engineered, as Catapult were unwilling to reveal the file format (and I didn't spot the specification in the manual either). As a consequence, the reader will not work for all catapult files, nor are there any guarantees that the results are correct for any files, even if it appears to work. No compression handling built in, so the reader cannot handle compressed files.

The sign of data differs between data read from raw files with this function and corresponding data exported with the Catapult Sprint software. Moreover, the order of channels differs from the export as well.

Look to sampleRead.m for use. Sample data provided in the sampleData folder.
